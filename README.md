## Analog Electronics Levels:
- [AE-Level 1A](#ae-level-1a)
- [AE-Level 1B]
- [AE-Level 1C]

## Digital Electronics Levels:
- [DE-Level 1A]
- [DE-Level 1B]
- [DE-Level 1C]

## Analog Electronics:
### AE-Level 1A:
Important Topics:
1. Resistor colour code table
2. LED voltage drop off based on their colour
3. Current rating of LEDs, which is usually 20 mA. It ranges between 10 mA - 30 mA
4. R = (V-Vf)/I
5. P = VI
6. V = IR

Question asked in the Assessment:  
They will give you input voltage, LED's colour, and current rating of LED. Find the minimum resistance needed to be used in the circuit so that the LED wont be damaged.  
  
Tips:
- If the minimum resistance value you got is 350 ohm, but the resistance available in assessment is only 330 ohm and 420 ohm. You should always go for the larger value i.e. 420 ohm here. As it ensures the LED doesnt get damaged.
