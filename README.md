## Analog Electronics:
### AE-Level 1A:
Important topics:
1. Resistor colour code table
2. LED voltage drop off based on their colour
3. Current rating of LEDs, which is usually 20 mA. It ranges between 10 mA - 30 mA
4. R = (V-Vf)/I
5. P = VI
6. V = IR

Question asked in the assessment:  
They will give you input voltage, LED's colour, and current rating of LED. Find the minimum resistance needed to be used in the circuit so that the LED wont be damaged.  
  
Tips:
- If the minimum resistance value you got is 350 ohm, but the resistance available in assessment is only 330 ohm and 420 ohm. You should always go for the larger value i.e. 420 ohm here. As it ensures the LED doesnt get damaged.  
  
Viva:  
Basic questions about the circuit you've built.  

### AE-Level 1B:
Important topics:
1. Wheatstone bridge
2. Voltage divider
3. Current divider
4. Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)
5. Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL)

Questions asked in the assessment:
1. Battery level indicator, based on voltage drop across LEDs.
2. Blinking circuit, by lowering frequency.
3. LED should turn off slowly when current is cut, circuit can be built by using capacitor.
5. Wheatstone bridge, create a balanced circuit type question.
6. LED should not turn off when button is pressed continuously, built by connecting a capacitor parallel to the LED.

Tips:  
- Be thorough in KCL and KVL, and how voltage drops across resistors and LEDs.
- How wheatstone bridge circuit works and why it works.

Viva:  
[Wheatstone bridge question](https://postimg.cc/18vVWbHN)  
From this question, between what two points current will not flow.  
Same question with different number of resistors and resistor values will be asked in the assessment.
